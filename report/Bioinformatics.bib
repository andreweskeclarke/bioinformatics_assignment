	abstract = {To understand the structure and function of a protein, an important task is to know where it occurs in the cell. Thus, a computational method for properly predicting the subcellular location of proteins would be significant in interpreting the original data produced by the large-scale genome sequencing projects. The present work tries to explore an effective method for extracting features from protein primary sequence and find a novel measurement of similarity among proteins for classifying a protein to its proper subcellular location. We considered four locations in eukaryotic cells and three locations in prokaryotic cells, which have been investigated by several groups in the past. A combined feature of primary sequence defined as a 430D (dimensional) vector was utilized to represent a protein, including 20 amino acid compositions, 400 dipeptide compositions and 10 physicochemical properties. To evaluate the prediction performance of this encoding scheme, a jackknife test based on nearest neighbor algorithm was employed. The prediction accuracies for cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteins in the former dataset were 86.3\%, 89.2\%, 73.5\% and 89.4\%, respectively, and the total prediction accuracy reached 86.3\%. As for the prediction accuracies of cytoplasmic, extracellular, and periplasmic proteins in the latter dataset, the prediction accuracies were 97.4\%, 86.0\%, and 79.7, respectively, and the total prediction accuracy of 92.5\% was achieved. The results indicate that this method outperforms some existing approaches based on amino acid composition or amino acid composition and dipeptide composition.},

	abstract = {How to incorporate the sequence order effect is a key and logical step for improving the prediction quality of protein subcellular location, but meanwhile it is a very difficult problem as well. This is because the number of possible sequence order patterns in proteins is extremely large, which has posed a formidable barrier to construct an effective training data set for statistical treatment based on the current knowledge. That is why most of the existing prediction algorithms are operated based on the amino-acid composition alone. In this paper, based on the physicochemical distance between amino acids, a set of sequence-order-coupling numbers was introduced to reflect the sequence order effect, or in a rigorous term, the quasi-sequence-order effect. Furthermore, the covariant discriminant algorithm by Chou and Elrod (Protein Eng. 12, 107–118, 1999) developed recently was augmented to allow the prediction performed by using the input of both the sequence-order-coupling numbers and amino-acid composition. A remarkable improvement was observed in the prediction quality using the augmented covariant discriminant algorithm. The approach described here represents one promising step forward in the efforts of incorporating sequence order effect in protein subcellular location prediction. It is anticipated that the current approach may also have a series of impacts on the prediction of other protein features by statistical approaches.},

	abstract = {Protein segments that form amphipathic α-helices in their native state have periodic variation in the hydrophobicity values of the residues along the segment, with a 3.6 residue per cycle period characteristic of the α-helix. The assignment of hydrophobicity values to amino acids (hydrophobicity scale) affects the display of periodicity. Thirty-eight published hydrophobicity scales are compared for their ability to identify the characteristic period of α-helices, and an optimum scale for this purpose is computed using a new eigenvector method. Two of the published scales are also characterized by eigenvectors. We compare the usual method for detecting periodicity based on the discrete Fourier transform with a method based on a least-squares fit of a harmonic sequence to a sequence of hydrophobicity values. The two become equivalent for very long sequences, but, for shorter sequences with lengths commonly found in α-helices, the least-squares procedure gives a more reliable estimate of the period. The analog to the usual Fourier transform power spectrum is the “least-squares power spectrum”, the sum of squares accounted for in fitting a sinusoid of given frequency to a sequence of hydrophobicity values. The sum of the spectra of the α-helices in our data base peaks at 97.5 °, and approximately 50\% of the helices can account for this peak. Thus, approximately 50\% of the α-helices appear to be amphipathic, and, of those that are, the dominant frequency at 97.5 ° rather than 100 ° indicates that the helix is slightly more open than previously thought, with the number of residues per turn closer to 3.7 than 3.6. The extra openness is examined in crystallographic data, and is shown to be associated with the C terminus of the helix. The alpha amphipathic index, the key quantity in our analysis, measures the fraction of the total spectral area that is under the 97.5 ° peak, and is a characteristic of hydrophobicity scales that is consistent for different sets of helices. Our optimized scale maximizes the amphipathic index and has a correlation of 0.85 or higher with nine previously published scales. The most surprising feature of the optimized scale is that arginine tends to behave as if it were hydrophobic; i.e. in the crystallographic data base it has a tendency to be on the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix. Although the scale is optimal only for predicting α-amphipathicity, it also ranks high in identifying β-amphipathicity and in distinguishing interior from exterior residues in a protein. We factor the expressions for the power spectra into a matrix product so that the helical sequence information is isolated from the hydrophobicity scale. The largest eigenvalue of the matrix containing only helical sequence information also identifies the 97.5 ° frequency, thus confirming a 3.7 residue per turn spacing independently of hydrophobicity scales.},

	abstract = {The function of a protein is closely correlated with its subcellular location. With the rapid increase in new protein sequences entering into data banks, we are confronted with a challenge: is it possible to utilize a bioinformatic approach to help expedite the determination of protein subcellular locations? To explore this problem, proteins were classified, according to their subcellular locations, into the following 12 groups: (1) chloroplast, (2) cytoplasm, (3) cytoskeleton, (4) endoplasmic reticulum, (5) extracell, (6) Golgi appar- atus, (7) lysosome, (8) mitochondria, (9) nucleus, (10) peroxisome, (11) plasma membrane and (12) vacuole. Based on the classification scheme that has covered almost all the organelles and subcellular compartments in an animal or plant cell, a covariant discriminant algorithm was proposed to predict the subcellular location of a query protein according to its amino acid composition. Results obtained through self-consistency, jackknife and independent dataset tests indicated that the rates of correct prediction by the current algorithm are significantly higher than those by the existing methods. It is anticipated that the classification scheme and concept and also the prediction algorithm can expedite the functionality determination of new proteins, which can also be of use in the prioritization of genes and proteins identified by genomic efforts as potential molecular targets for drug design.},

	abstract = {We introduce a computational method for identifying subcellular
 locations of proteins from the phylogenetic distribution of the
 homologs of organellar proteins. This method is based on the
 observation that proteins localized to a given organelle by experiments
 tend to share a characteristic phylogenetic distribution of their
 homologs—a phylogenetic profile. Therefore any other protein can be
 localized by its phylogenetic profile. Application of this method to
 mitochondrial proteins reveals that nucleus-encoded proteins previously
 known to be destined for mitochondria fall into three groups:
 prokaryote-derived, eukaryote-derived, and organism-specific (i.e.,
 found only in the organism under study). Prokaryote-derived
 mitochondrial proteins can be identified effectively by their
 phylogenetic profiles. In the yeast Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae, 361 nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins can be
 identified at 50\% accuracy with 58\% coverage. From these values and
 the proportion of conserved mitochondrial genes, it can be inferred
 that ≈630 genes, or 10\% of the nuclear genome, is devoted to
 mitochondrial function. In the worm
 Caenorhabditis elegans, we estimate that
 there are ≈660 nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes, or 4\% of its
 genome, with ≈400 of these genes contributed from the prokaryotic
 mitochondrial ancestor. The large fraction of organism-specific and
 eukaryote-derived genes suggests that mitochondria perform specialized
 roles absent from prokaryotic mitochondrial ancestors. We observe
 measurably distinct phylogenetic profiles among proteins from different
 subcellular compartments, allowing the general use of prokaryotic
 genomes in learning features of eukaryotic proteins.},
